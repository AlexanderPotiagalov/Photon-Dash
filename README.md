# Photon-Dash
## Description
A game where you control a photon, aiming to reach the finish line as fast as possible! Bounce off mirrors to change direction, travel through glass and water to alter speed, and strategically avoid the deadly void along the way.

This project was developed during a hackathon with the theme "Faster Than Light." Inspired by the concept of photons, the game challenges players to achieve the fastest possible time, emphasizing the speed of light. It features a timer that tracks the playerâ€™s best time, adding a competitive element.

I created the entire frontend website using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and intuitive user interface. Additionally, I contributed to the backend game logic during the final hours of the hackathon, working closely with the team to ensure a smooth integration of game mechanics.
